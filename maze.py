    This class used to represent the node of a maze

    Attributes
    ----------
    graph : Dictionary
        represent the graph  
    value : String
        represents the id of the vertex
    parent : MazeNode
        represents the parent of the current node
  
    Methods
    -------
    __eq__(self, other)
        Determines if the current node is the same with the other 
    is_the_solution(self, final_state)
        Checks if the current node is the solution
    extend_node(self)
        Extends the current node, creating a new instance of MazeNode for each edge starts from current node 
    _find_path(self)
        Find the path (all verticies and edges from the intitial state to the final state)
    __str__(self)
        Returns the solution of the maze, the whole path vertex by vertex in order to be printed properly.
